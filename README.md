# Inspiration for website design

<I dont want just a simple website. I mean it should be simple, but it should be something that represents me!>

1. Im thinking of multi layer website, with a main content on center part of the main webpage, and everything else around it.
2. ofc it will have both light and dark theme, and instead of traditional sun and moon im thinking of something else like:
3. I think i should hide a menu bar, and show a little handle hinting something is there: clicking it will open all the options for client(viewer) about my projects and how to contact me
4. My profile photo will have my mr. duck photo as well my own photo, one on each side, and clicking-holding one one will flip it, randomly showing either of those sides.
5. I need to show a clear grid of my tech stack. Im thinking, on the front center side(the main content) there will be some option to open my tech stack (it will be short at first and then when clicked on it, it will direct to a page, showing everything ofc it will also be accessable from the side hidden menu)
6. I wanna add a little bit of anime style theme to whole website (it can add some kawaii girl references here and there for fun perspectives (for example, anime girl tilting her head acc to the pointer position))
7. I also intend to showcase my realtime github, leetcode and codeforces stats on the portfolio: these things will be in about me section of portfolio
8. I wanna make using the cursor as fun as possible, it can always be accompanied by a cat, trying to cling to the cursor, and it will jump off to nearby objects like buttons or other icons, and will behave independently of other things expect cursor itself. it will jump back to the cursor when the cursor gets comes closer to the cat.

# the cursor following eyes

- they will also tell you about the thing the cursor is pointing at
- if we click on the eye, that eye will close temporarily, when when it opens, it will have some red marks from pain which will go away after some time
- also, all the clickable objects will show a distinctive propertiy on hovering, which will tell user to click on it, and the eyes will tell exactly what will happen after clicking
